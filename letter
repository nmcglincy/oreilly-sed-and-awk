This is the ASCII file created for manipulation
during the Emacs module of the Introduction to unix course.

In this class you have learned many tools associated with the
unix system.  You have learned how unix stores its files and how
you can manipulate the locations and permissions of those files.
You have also learned how to use another editor that will allow you
to manipulate the contents of an ASCII text file on the Unix system.

This file will be manipulated using the Emacs editor.
Follow the directions in the emacs submit to know what
changes to make to the file.  Append the contents of this file
to the end of your assignment file for submission.
This file was created by Jan Plane and will be submitted in its
modified form.

This paragraph won't eve appear in the final version of this
file because the directions will tell you to delete the whole
thing with one command.  Actually it would be a good idea to try
it both ways - delete all of the lines one at a time and delete
all of the lines with one command.  The command you use to do it
in one command is the one that should be put into the commands
list file.

This paragraph will be copied and then pasted several places in
the file.

With this paragraph you will practice using blocks.
The parts **between the stars** should be moved to after the stars.

There may be some misspelled wrods in this documnt.  You will use the
spell check feature of emacs to fix those.
