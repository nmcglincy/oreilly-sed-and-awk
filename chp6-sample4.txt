My wife won't let me buy a power saw. She is afraid of an
accident if I use one.
So I rely on a hand saw for a variety of weekend projects like

have to use a power
saw. The speed and efficiency provided by power tools
would be essential to being productive.

using these programs can save many hours of repetitive
work in achieving the same result.
